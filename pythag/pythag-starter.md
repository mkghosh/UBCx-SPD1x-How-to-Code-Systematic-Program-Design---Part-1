#####The ques is How to calculate the value of the absicsa of a right angled triangle using BSL.
The simplest and normal way to do it is using the below expression.
(sqrt (+ (* 3 3) (* 4 4))) 

The more efficient and good looking way to do this is to use both sqrt and sqr function. and the expression is given below.
(sqrt (+ (sqr 3) (sqr 4)))

**Thank you**
